## UX
<b>[eat.drink.sleep(repeat)](https://matthewpoyner.github.io/eat.drink.sleep/)</b> is a site designed to help users find where they can get something to eat, somewhere to get a coffee or alcoholic drink and lay their head down at the end of the day.
<br>The site is designed to offer this information to the user in a helpful, user friendly manner.
<br>

## User stories
I emmigrated to New Zealand in February 2019 from the UK<br>I was new to the city where I would now be living and did not know where anything was! I can use this site to easily locate somewhere to grab some food or drink or a place to stay.<br>Because of the city search I can also travel with confidence to other destinations, knowing that I can find what I need in other locations around the world too.

Other users worldwide can use this site to find the restaurants, cafes, bars or hotels in their chosen location.
